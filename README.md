This is a web app for an actual car rental agency (althought they didn't actually hire me or anything 😐)

## Features :
<li>User registration</li>
<li>Car reservations</li>
<li>Admin dashboadr for proccessing reservations and site content</li>
<li>Ratings and reviews system (the actual agency defintly wouldn't approve this 💀)</li>

## tech stack :

### <li>React
### <li>Node js
### <li>Express 
### <li>SQLite 

<small>why sqlite and not MongoDB ? </small>
<small>I want this be a realistic project so, I think it makes total sense to just store all data in a basic sqlite data base and have the car images in the public folder </small>
